# policyAlgorithms

This Repo contains implementation of basic policy algorithms.
First of all Reinforce and  then its extensions Reinforce with baseline and actor-critic,
Both of these aim to reduce variance in updates.

This project was done around 2017, therefore library and python versions are unknown
(will be edited asap as I have new PC and can experiment with virtual envs)
